<h3><center>üçï PIZZA ORDERING WITH PYTHON</center></h3>
Hello and welcome! It is nice to have you here. I'd like to share with you a beginner Python project which uses if statements. Please refer to Pizza Ordering with Python.ipynb for code.
If you want to have a more interactive experience see my code in replit: https://replit.com/@vivianekarpinsk/Pizza-Order

If you are looking to learn Python and understand this project I recommend checking out 100 Days of Code on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/ which is where this project comes from.

<h4>A little about me:</h4>
I'm a college student finishing up my Bachelors in Data Analytics. Follow me on GitHub to see my journey and don't forget to share yours as well. 

Keep rocking on! You're alredy ahead of those who didn't start yet!
